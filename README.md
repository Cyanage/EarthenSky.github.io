Websites are probably useful.

**Right now this is just a test website [^-^]**

**Code Style:**

Code Sections:
  Code sections are broken up inside of a script with:

    *//< + nameOfSection + ' ' + Start* to start a section.  ex. *//<CollisionCode Start*
    and *//nameOfSection + ' ' + End + />* to end a section.  ex. *//CollisionCode End/>*

  Code sections are only for reference and ease of code readability.
  Section starts and ends are based off of html tags.

Bracket Style:
  This code uses the K&R variant *Stroustrup*.
