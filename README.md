Websites are probably useful.

**Right now this is just a test website [^-^]**

**Code Style:**
===============

Code Sections:

  - Code sections are broken up inside of a script with:

  ```
  //< + nameOfSection + ' ' + Start
  ```

  to start a section.  ex. *//<CollisionCode Start*

  ```
  //nameOfSection + ' ' + End + />
  ```

  to end a section.  ex. *//CollisionCode End/>*

  ```
  //!nameOfEmphasis!
  ```

  is used to emphasize or tag a function.  ex. *//!Combat!*

  - Code sections are only for reference and ease of code readability.
  - Section starts and ends are based off of html tags.

Comments:

  - Comments come after a double space.

  ```
  if(foo() === true) { foo(); }  //foo again!
  ```

  - No comment punctuation or spelling.

Bracket Style:  

  - This code uses the K&R variant *Stroustrup*.
