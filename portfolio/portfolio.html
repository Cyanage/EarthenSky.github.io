To fit the darkness of this cave system I put a lot of effort into creating a strong and memorable baseline.  To convey the uncertainty of this sort of place I filled one section with bits of dissonance (in rhythm and pitch) and added a phaser to the instruments used to make the listener feel like something is off.</td>
